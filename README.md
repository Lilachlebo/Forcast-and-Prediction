# Forcast-and-Prediction
- This is a machine learning project.
- The aim of the project is to advice a Fitness club regarding its customer retention strategy. 
- In this project I will:
- • predict the probability of churn (for the upcoming month) for each customer
- • Draw up typical user portraits: select the most outstanding groups and describe their main features
- • Analyze the factors that impact churn most
- • Draw basic conclusions and develop recommendations on how to improve customer service:
    - o Identify target groups
    - o Suggest measures to cut churn
    - o Describe any other patterns you see with respect to interaction with customers
